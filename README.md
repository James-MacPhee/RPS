Contribution per partner:
We actually both programmed our own programs and realized we both had the same error of not being able to loop through.
We then decided to work together and figured that problem out together. We then chose to submit a combined copy.
So we contributed equally.

Compile:
gcc <cfile.c> -o <cfile>

Run:
## ./server 6012
## ./client bluenose 6012
